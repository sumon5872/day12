    <h3>what is typography, and why it is important? a beginner's gride</h3>

   <p> <b>Whether it’s on our phones, in books or on websites, we’re constantly digesting written words. From instruction booklets to shop fronts, type is all around us. We often reflect on the power of the written word, but rarely do we consider the designer’s role in emulating the tone of the word or sentence.

Behind the scenes, a designer has taken the time to consider the relationship between the look of the text and what the text says. In reality, different moods, atmospheres and emotions can be expressed simply through the type choice. But what actually is typography—and why is it so vital?

In this article, we’ll lift the lid on everything you need to know about typography. We’ll start with the definition of typography, including a brief history of its origins. We’ll then address the benefits of good typography and the impact it can have on your users. Finally, we’ll look into the different elements that comprise typography, and what they all mean.</b> </p>
